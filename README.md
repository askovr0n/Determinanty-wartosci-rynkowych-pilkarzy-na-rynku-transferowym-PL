# Determinanty-wartosci-rynkowych-pilkarzy-na-rynku-transferowym-PL

- The paper examines the determinants of the market values of 150 football players from the world's top five leagues in the 2020/2021 season (as of 28/12/2021)
- Linear regression was used for modelling
- The assumptions of linear regression were verified, such as correct functional form (RESET test), homoskedasticity (Breusch-Peagan test), normality of the distribution of the residuals (Jarque-Bera test), autocorrelation of the residuals (Durbin-Watson test)
- Outlier observations were examined using standardised residuals, leverage and Cook's distance. The VIF metric was used to test for collinearity between variables
- R software was used for data mining, engineering and modelling
- Significant variables with a significant impact on the price of footballers appeared to be: age of the footballer squared, number of followers on Instagram, number of goals scored
